# Minimum-Wage
My first real Java program I wrote from scratch to do something significant. This computer simulation of wage efficiency in a rudimentary economy was a rudimentary way to test a hypothesis, as this was created for the 2016 Adams Central science fair (Junior year high school project).

**Warning: This was created before I had a true understanding of Computer Science practices, so there are undoubtably numerous faults in the code included in this codebase.**
